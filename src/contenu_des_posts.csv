Keep them coming if you can think of any other improvements/updates guys. \n"", ""\nHey\xa0@Cleoriff\xa0,\xa0@gmarkj\xa0and everyone, took me a while sorry for the delay, but I got some information that we could add into the SIM swap guide based on your ideas above.  I'll paste below:\n\xa0\nNew devices come with 3 sims so you can choose the size which fits your phone\n\xa0\nA SIM card is sent with the 3 size option: Standard, Micro and Nano SIM. You just need to break out what size you require. It is detailed on the card what area you need to break out for what size. A recommendation is to do it carefully as breaking out the Nano when a Mirco SIM is needed will require a whole new SIM to be sent.\n\xa0\nIs the sim blank or does it have a temporary number attached?\xa0\n\xa0\nThere is no number attached to a replacement Pay Monthly SIM card, it is blank.\n\xa0\nFinally the question we are always being asked is, do I do the swap from my old sim or the new one?\xa0\n\xa0\nIf texting\xa0'Swap' to\xa020220 to activate the SIM this needs to be sent from the old SIM only, the new SIM won‚Äôt be active to enable this.\n\xa0\nSIM swaps can now also be actioned via your My O2 app. You‚Äôll find an option under ‚ÄòManage your account‚Äô of ‚ÄòSwap your SIM‚Äô. You‚Äôll need to re-enter your My O2 username and password, you‚Äôll then be sent a verification code via text to your phone. Once this has been confirmed you can enter your new SIM info and this will be swapped within 24hrs.\n\xa0\nAs mentioned above you can also text ‚ÄòSwap‚Äô to 20220 to activate it.\n\xa0\nIf you don‚Äôt have an active SIM to do either of the above to you‚Äôll need to call customer services to activate it. Please be aware they can only activate SIMs that have been ordered off your account for security reasons.\n\xa0\n"", '\nThat sounds excellent @Marjo\xa0\n\nVeritas Numquam Perit\n\n', '\nFYI guys, the SIM swap guide has been updated. \n', ""\n@Marjo\xa0Changes look good, though I have mentioned on the thread that sometimes there is no need to sim swap if the old sim fits the new phone.
