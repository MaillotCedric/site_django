I'll paste below:\n\xa0\nNew devices come with 3 sims so you can choose the size which fits your phone\n\xa0\nA SIM card is sent with the 3 size option: Standard, Micro and Nano SIM. You just need to break out what size you require. It is detailed on the card what area you need to break out for what size. A recommendation is to do it carefully as breaking out the Nano when a Mirco SIM is needed will require a whole new SIM to be sent.\n\xa0\nIs the sim blank or does it have a temporary number attached?\xa0\n\xa0\nThere is no number attached to a replacement Pay Monthly SIM card, it is blank.\n\xa0\nFinally the question we are always being asked is, do I do the swap from my old sim or the new one?\xa0\n\xa0\nIf texting\xa0'Swap' to\xa020220 to activate the SIM this needs to be sent from the old SIM only, the new SIM won‚Äôt be active to enable this.\n\xa0\nSIM swaps can now also be actioned via your My O2 app. You‚Äôll find an option under ‚ÄòManage your account‚Äô of ‚ÄòSwap your SIM‚Äô. You‚Äôll need to re-enter your My O2 username and password, you‚Äôll then be sent a verification code via text to your phone. Once this has been confirmed you can enter your new SIM info and this will be swapped within 24hrs.\n\xa0\nAs mentioned above you can also text ‚ÄòSwap‚Äô to 20220 to activate it.\n\xa0\nIf you don‚Äôt have an active SIM to do either of the above to you‚Äôll need to call customer services to activate it. Please be aware they can only activate SIMs that have been ordered off your account for security reasons.\n\xa0\n"", '\nThat sounds excellent @Marjo\xa0\n\nVeritas Numquam Perit\n\n', '\nFYI guys, the SIM swap guide has been updated. \n', ""\n@Marjo\xa0Changes look good, though I have mentioned on the thread that sometimes there is no need to sim swap if the old sim fits the new phone.

It beggars belief.\xa0I now have this detritus on my credit score and it's me who has to sort it all out.\xa002, I shall be seeking compensation from you and I really want to know how someone can push the 'ok button' without me being informed by post. \xa0Utter nonsense and a real pain in the butt.\xa0Bloody fuming\xa0\n"", '\n@pedro32\xa0If you message O2 on Facebook (https://o2uk.co/O2CFB) , Twitter (https://o2uk.co/O2CTW) or Instagram (https://o2uk.co/O2CIG) , they should be able to help you with this.02fraudteam@02.com\n\n\tI have no affiliation whatsoever with O2 or any subsidiary companies.

Complaints Department,"[""\nI sent this 6 days ago to O2 'complaint\xa0review service''\xa0as I was so frustrated.Dear SirsFor a number of months now I have been buying additional data via ‚Äòbolt-ons‚Äô whenever I exceeded my 6Gb data allowance. \xa0This was proving to be very expensive...\xa0\xa0So I contacted yourselves several times both by telephone call and on your website to see if I could change to a more suitable package, but each time I was informed by a) voice call that there was no option to ‚Äòupgrade‚Äô other than for a significant monthly increase and also b) your website informed me that there were no tariffs available.\xa0Today I researched other providers and found there was a much more suitable - and less expensive - package for my needs, and so I contacted yourselves to obtain a PAC code in order to change. \xa0This was provided and then your customer service agent commented that I had been a long-standing customer and asked me why I was leaving. \xa0When I explained the above he informed me that I could have a ‚Äò30Gb Plan‚Äô for a monthly cost of ¬£15.00!So it appears that \xa0I have spent a significant amount of money (and time) unnecessarily in order to obtain data via bolt-ons and I would like your response as to why that is please.\xa0So far, not even an acknowledgement of my email of the 21st September...\xa0VERY disappointing of O2 customer service.\n"", '\nThis is not O2.
