I'll paste below:\n\xa0\nNew devices come with 3 sims so you can choose the size which fits your phone\n\xa0\nA SIM card is sent with the 3 size option: Standard, Micro and Nano SIM. You just need to break out what size you require. It is detailed on the card what area you need to break out for what size. A recommendation is to do it carefully as breaking out the Nano when a Mirco SIM is needed will require a whole new SIM to be sent.\n\xa0\nIs the sim blank or does it have a temporary number attached?\xa0\n\xa0\nThere is no number attached to a replacement Pay Monthly SIM card, it is blank.\n\xa0\nFinally the question we are always being asked is, do I do the swap from my old sim or the new one?\xa0\n\xa0\nIf texting\xa0'Swap' to\xa020220 to activate the SIM this needs to be sent from the old SIM only, the new SIM won‚Äôt be active to enable this.\n\xa0\nSIM swaps can now also be actioned via your My O2 app. You‚Äôll find an option under ‚ÄòManage your account‚Äô of ‚ÄòSwap your SIM‚Äô. You‚Äôll need to re-enter your My O2 username and password, you‚Äôll then be sent a verification code via text to your phone. Once this has been confirmed you can enter your new SIM info and this will be swapped within 24hrs.\n\xa0\nAs mentioned above you can also text ‚ÄòSwap‚Äô to 20220 to activate it.\n\xa0\nIf you don‚Äôt have an active SIM to do either of the above to you‚Äôll need to call customer services to activate it. Please be aware they can only activate SIMs that have been ordered off your account for security reasons.\n\xa0\n"", '\nThat sounds excellent @Marjo\xa0\n\nVeritas Numquam Perit\n\n', '\nFYI guys, the SIM swap guide has been updated. \n', ""\n@Marjo\xa0Changes look good, though I have mentioned on the thread that sometimes there is no need to sim swap if the old sim fits the new phone.

Considering my options after a stolen device,"[""\nHi my S21 Ultra was stolen and not insured for loss/theft.I'm currently using my slightly damaged S9 which is fine except for photography. Using my older S9 is not ideal because I upgraded so I can use multiple lenses/cameras for photography and videography.\xa0I initially reported my phone stolen with O2 and the police, but then asked O2 to unblock the device so I could track it's location. Using offline tracking provided by Samsung the phone appeared in Romania shortly after it was stolen.\xa0My options now with the existing refresh contract seem to be:\xa0- Upgrade and pay the remainder of the contract for the device which is over ¬£700 in order to buy a new device from O2 with a single line.\xa0- Take up a second line with O2 and pay off both the stolen and new devices and contracts simultaneously\xa0- Take up a contract for a new device with a different provider, request a PAC code and disconnect my o2 account leaving me with a debt of over ¬£700 and then see if the payment management team will set up a payment plan for that debt.\xa0- Keep using my S9 and not be able to enjoy my passion of mobile photography and videography as much due to the single camera not performing very well when a telephoto lens is more suited (as digital zoom is not really the way I want to go with my photography)\xa0- Buy a replacement device outright (or on finance) that has adequate photography and video capabilities and use my existing O2 contract and SIM with a new device.\xa0All of these options are somewhat disheartening as I'm trying to reduce my spending, but still enjoy the features that newer phones bring.I will make sure I'm insured against theft in future that's for sure!\xa0I don't necessarily need to do photography and video and the damage to the S9 is workable (I just can't use the volume buttons as they are damaged) but I'd have to wait a long time (until Dec 2024) for my current contract (device plan) to be fully paid off.\xa0I've spoken to customer services, sales and payment management now for many hours to see if there's anything they can do to soften the blow, and the answer was no, hence the current options available to me.\xa0I'm more than happy to consider a more affordable handset such as a Google Pixel, Xiaomi Redmi Note, OnePlus Nord, Realme, and other Samsung Galaxy models. Basically anything with good rear cameras that isn't made by Apple and isn't a knock-off product (ie. it's from a reputable manufacturer).\xa0Is there anything I've missed, or perhaps any suggestions that you can bring?

It's an absolute steal, has considerable advantages over the Redmi Note 11 Pro (the latest model).I'm currently looking at used handsets as I'm counting the pennies and I've models in new or good condition for ¬£170 or ¬£180 (delivered) which I believe include warranty. I'd be looking at around double or more of the cost to be able to get a camera system that performs anywhere near as well, although the proof is in the pudding. To help me get back on track there are 0% interest finance options available using Klarna (which I've not used before) which is looking good to me as I can spread the payment over 3 months.I have kept the tracking of my stolen phone possible by means of leaving it unblocked on the basis that the data is secured (encrypted) and the phone is locked.My next steps might be to look into some queries:- Is it possible for someone handling my stolen handset to use it in any way shape or form?- Is my encrypted data safe?- For any data which isn't encrypted or is able to be gathered (ie. on the home screen) what are the security considerations for how that data may be used?- If there is a way for others to use the phone (ie. factory reset) should I ask the Romanian authorities if it is possible to notify me if the IMEI linked to the physical hardware (the phone) is ever used to make calls/texts? This alert is in place only in the UK at the moment, and via a global IMEI tracking service/website. Individual countries and authorities will have more scope for tracking IMEI's than 3rd party services as they are able to utilise the live data from major networks as opposed to relying on historic databases. The last known location of my phone was in a specific part of a town/city in Romania so I could make some guesses as to where it may have gone from there or how it may have been used (or left in a pile somewhere if deemed unusable due to the protections I had set up).\n"", ""\nUpdate: It's now possible to buy the Redmi Note 10 Pro brand new in box for ¬£155 (delivered, UK) which sounds like a better deal than a used model for ¬£170 to me!The Redmi Note 12 is expected for release on 14th Sept (in 4 days time) but I don't think it will immediately bring the price of the Note 10 Pro down much as it is already so cheap.\n"", ""\n@dreas\xa0I'm not quite sure why you still think you need to keep tracking your stolen phone? You're not going to get it back, and you're leaving the possibility of any personal data you had on the phone open to being compromised.

You really should block the phone completely, make it unusable to whoever has it now and move on.\n\nI DO NOT WORK FOR O2\n\n"", '\nWhy not simply remote wipe it and get\xa0 it blocked\n\nO2 Social Media(Twitter | Instagram | Facebook)\n\n', '\nYou and\xa0@jonsie make a very good point, the chances of getting it back are slim.I think the chances of being able to remotely wipe the data are also slim though, and that may have been the case since the phone was stolen and immediately turned off. I couldn\'t say which is more likely to happen, but I think that if there is a 2% chance of getting the phone back, then there is probably less than 1% chance of being able to remotely wipe the data at this (or any) stage, maybe even 0.01%.\xa0If I had wiped the data immediately after loss, I would never have known it was stolen (it could have been dropped and found) and I wouldn\'t have received the notification of it\'s location through offline tracking. I don\'t think remotely wiping the data would have worked as the phone was only ever tracked through offline tracking once, and the way that offline tracking works is that another Samsung device has detected my phone through a wireless or other network. I\'m not sure that the connection from another Samsung device detecting my phone would have been able to be used to send the command back to the phone to wipe it.From Samsung: ""After using the Factory Data Reset option\xa0you will no longer be able to use the Find My Mobile service.""\xa0The chances of someone being able to access my encrypted data are also slim, and they are so slim that I think it\'s considerably more likely that they would find a way to wipe the data as opposed to decrypting it.Whilst nothing is 100% secure, if we were to assume the encryption methods are 99.99% secure then that would certainly be secure enough for my peace of mind in this instance.\xa0As reusing the device requires a considerable amount of work, and as it was stolen along with a large volume of other phones and taken 1000 miles away, my best guess is that it\'s been discarded and the phones without high levels of encryption used first.\n', ""\nHi my S21 Ultra was stolen and not insured for loss/theft.I'm currently using my slightly damaged S9 which is fine except for photography.

Fraud Alert!,"['\nThis message is to send an alert and awareness to all O2 subscribers and phone Owners and Users. As with most businesses and public resources, there is now a plethora of fraudsters and scammers operating through O2. O2 is well aware of this issue but, as a public facing company, will do nothing to help victims of O2 scam and fraud.in all my 40 years of owning mobile phones from many phone companies and third parties, for the first time, i had fraudsters and scammers plaguing my O2 phone most of yesterday 22/09/2022. I ran to O2 for help, and received none. Embarrassingly, the scammers were using O2 numbers and customer services techniques to scam me. O2 customer services asked me the same questions in exactly the same way the scammers asked me. It got so confusing that I could not tell one from the other. I had to come to the unswerving conclusion that perhaps in a bid to scale up her business, O2 is working with scammers and fraudsters.The following are phone numbers you should be wary of: 01526 210024, 0203 840 4722, 2023 287 6812, 0800 840 0202. The scammers called my phone asking me my security questions, and when i gave a false answer, they corrected me by giving me the correct answer. This is an answer only O2 should have but the scammers also had it. There were other information which should have been exlusive to O2 only, but the scammers had it also. In addition to the phne numbers which the scammers used on me, they had names like ""Peter"", ""Smith"", ""Ben"", ""Alex"". Common with them is the accent which sounded very much of ""Indian"" origin. One of the phone calls was from Lincoln, London and others were from eslewhere.\xa0Personally, I strongly believe there is an official O2 involvement in all these scamming and fraudulent activities. I hope someone out there can and would call O2 out for this as O2 appears unfazed about it.\n', '\n@Olomola\xa0Report it to the police:\xa0https://www.actionfraud.police.uk/ Your accusation is absurd and racist.\xa0\n\nI DO NOT WORK FOR O2\n\n', '\nActually Bambino, nothing I have written is absurd, nor Racist or an accusation. If you have carefully read my contributions, you will realise that I wrote in first stand as someone who personally experienced all that I had written. Therefore, it is not false and not accusatory. Furthermore, it is not racist nor absurd because I spoke with my antagonist yesterday and several times today (already). I don‚Äôt know which part of India they might have come from, but as someone who has many Indian friends and grew up with Indian neighbours, I am better placed to recognise Indian accent.\xa0You may rightfully feel offended, but this does not remove the truth or facts from my experience and the race of those who antagonise me in this fraud and scam issue. If they were Nigerians, I would rightly say do. If they were Americans, I would also state that. As it is, individuals of Indian origin have unsuccessfully tried to fraud and scam me using O2 as a platform to do so.\xa0This is the undeniable truth and facts. Shortly before I received your comments, same individuals tried contacting me again using the name ‚ÄúPeter Smith‚Äù but called from 01526 210023 (which is different from 01526 210024 which I had blocked earlier this morning).\xa0The whole world is full of bad people and being bad is not exclusive to just one nation /nationality or geographical location only.

I'd like you to tell me what difference the race of the person trying to scam you makes? A scam is a scam, and the nationality of of the person making the call has nothing to do with it. It's a common criminal act. It happens all the time. Reading your lengthy posts, you'd think that you were the only person who has ever fallen for this. Do you honestly think that O2 is officially involved in scamming customers? That's a serious accusation and incredibly ridiculous. This happens on a daily basis to hundreds, maybe even thousands of people on every network. Are Vodafone, EE, and Three also officially involved in scamming their customers? If you think so, then maybe you should get a solicitor and take them all to court. I'm sure you'd succeed.\n\nI DO NOT WORK FOR O2\n\n"", '\nThanks for your informed narrative and insightful feedback and conclusion. I initially wrote that I had 40 years of experience owning phones from different suppliers and never a single experience of scam or fraud. This is apparently my first and hopefully my only experience.

Unless you are the owner or the CEO of O2, I honestly don‚Äôt see how my comments could adversely affect you or cause your discomfort. But unless, you have a personal stake in the scamming and fraudulent practices, your response should not be in praising it or comparing it across the board or championing it as a norm. It is a dastardly shameful practice regardless of which phone company or race or persons involved in it. It is an human act which I believe this community should join hands together and help O2 stamp out anyway it can.

If you look at my signature, you'll see that I don't work for O2. I'm a customer and have been a member of this community for twelve and a half years and have been a customer since it was called BT Cellnet. If you've owned phones for 40 years, that's a pretty good trick since the first mobiles weren't available generally until 1983.I've seen hundreds of posts from people who have been scammed, and in many of those posts I've offered methods of reporting the calls or texts. I've called you out on it because you have made absurd accusations and racist comments. If O2 had been officially involved in sanctioning scam calls, they would have been investigated and found out long ago. Go get a solicitor and prove it, if you think it's true. Whatever the race of the person who made those calls to you is immaterial, but you chose to point out what race you think they may be. THAT IS RACIST. GET IT?I'm done now. I will not respond again.\n\nI DO NOT WORK FOR O2\n\n"", '\nThank you bambino. I am also a customer and have rights which are fundamentally vital. My fundamental human rights allow me to speak or write the truth as I see or experienced it. I refuse to cower from your onslaught of ‚Äúrightness‚Äù feeling over my hurting experiences which is horrible and personal to me. This is also the last time I will respond to your comments. The usage of phones is not limited to digital phones alone, so while you refer to 1983, I refer to further back, and to analog phones as included in trans business and personal communication techniques and technology.\xa0\n', '\nThank you Jonsie.

Your response should be the golden standard for all who have more than the initial level.

As with most businesses and public resources, there is now a plethora of fraudsters and scammers operating through O2. O2 is well aware of this issue but, as a public facing company, will do nothing to help victims of O2 scam and fraud.in all my 40 years of owning mobile phones from many phone companies and third parties, for the first time, i had fraudsters and scammers plaguing my O2 phone most of yesterday 22/09/2022. I ran to O2 for help, and received none. Embarrassingly, the scammers were using O2 numbers and customer services techniques to scam me. O2 customer services asked me the same questions in exactly the same way the scammers asked me. It got so confusing that I could not tell one from the other. I had to come to the unswerving conclusion that perhaps in a bid to scale up her business, O2 is working with scammers and fraudsters.The following are phone numbers you should be wary of: 01526 210024, 0203 840 4722, 2023 287 6812, 0800 840 0202. The scammers called my phone asking me my security questions, and when i gave a false answer, they corrected me by giving me the correct answer. This is an answer only O2 should have but the scammers also had it. There were other information which should have been exlusive to O2 only, but the scammers had it also. In addition to the phne numbers which the scammers used on me, they had names like ""Peter"", ""Smith"", ""Ben"", ""Alex"". Common with them is the accent which sounded very much of ""Indian"" origin. One of the phone calls was from Lincoln, London and others were from eslewhere.\xa0Personally, I strongly believe there is an official O2 involvement in all these scamming and fraudulent activities. I hope someone out there can and would call O2 out for this as O2 appears unfazed about it.\n', ""\nI wouldn't say that there is o2 involvement but they instead got your details via their own methods I have received scam calls similar to what you have submitted but instead from my bank asking me where I live after giving me my own postcode. But I don't see why o2 won't help you at all. Call 202 with your o2 phone or reach then using social media links\n"", ""\n@Olomola\xa0Just some practical advice from O2.It's a well known scam.Block the number and report it free to 7726.DO NOT follow any links or enter any information.O2 advice here\xa0\xa0 https://www.o2.co.uk/help/safety-and-security/phishing-and-smishinghttps://www.actionfraud.police.uk/https://community.o2.co.uk/t5/Welcome-News/Phishing-Smishing-amp-Scams-Latest-info-amp-advice/m-p/13...\xa0\xa0How to block a number:https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00062352/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201229\xa0\xa0\n\nVeritas Numquam Perit\n\n"", '\n@Arasheed\xa0Thanks Arasheed. One big problem this odious event revealed to me is my inability to recognise phone scam of this day and age straight away. I often prided myself as being above falling for scams. It is truly a troubling thing to realise that I am not infallible. But, going forward, I have noted all the good suggestions and advice that I received, and would be more careful henceforth. However, I disagree that mentioning the identity or race of my scammers is racist. If we all subscribe to such views, no one on earth will be blameless. Throughout the night, I filled in opinion polls which asked me for my identity and ethnic group. Should that be viewed as racism now? We are who we are regardless of small minded people‚Äôs opinion or views. I am a Nigerian. For many years, it was reported that Nigerians were fraudulent. No one baited an eye even though it was not a true statement. The statement, although is false, does not represent the totality of all Nigerians. There are Nigerians working in financial institutions, government agencies etc. they are not fraudulent. Categorising identity of the people who scammed me as racist is very offensive and I sincerely hope someone would look into why the responder made such a statement.\xa0nonetheless, thanks for your comments\xa0@Arasheed.\n', '\n@Cleoriff\xa0\xa0My thanks. I blocked their number (s), and they keep calling with different numbers. Funny, I was thrown by the similarity of their call procedures with what I was used to coming from O2. \xa0The problem I have to deal with now is twofold. First, identifying genuine callers and secondly, loss of potential genuine incentives from genuine callers.\xa0Nonetheless, I am sincerely grateful for your comments.\xa0\n', ""\nI understand and I as well don't see how it could be racist mentioning someone's race especially in an informative paragraph but the best course of action is to move on with this part of the problem and solve the current problem you are facing with the spam calls.\xa0\n"", '\n@Olomola\xa0Now this is a real nuisance but you could think of a change of number.
