Poor service in store,"[""\nWent into Buxton and asked for a replacement 5G eSIM yesterday and the store assistant told me 'she didn't think they're even a thing yet' and all she could give me was a 4G one.

also had the same issue for several years with all data access shutting down completeley at peak hours in the middle of the day on O2 at Eastney Beach in Portsmouth, which is on the South Eastern edge of a large town.\xa0 Yet repeatedly O2's network could not cope over several years with the additional number of people brought in to the town to use the beaches on any warm and sunny summer day including weekdays but weekends were worst of all with data shutting down very early in the day.\xa0This year some time after May O2 finally solved the problem by upgrading a mast that covers the Eastney part of Portsmouth (which may well turn out to be a mast just across the water on the Isle of Wight) to 4G+ instead of 4G and now data services do seem to keep working during the day.\xa0 O2 also have a 5G cell somewhere between 2 and 3 miles west of Eastney somewhere between South Parade Pier and Clarence Pier.\xa0 At both these pier locations a 5G signal generally shows on my OnePlus N10 handset (it never has done since the start of the 5G transmitter there on the part of Eastney Beach near Fort Cumberland) but when the like Poole/Bournemouth when the town is really busy the capacity of the 5G mast simply isn't adequate so you get chucked off it first on to the 4G mast and then when that is overloaded too on to\xa0 the H+ mast.\xa0 You stay connected to the H+ mast in Central Portsmouth at busy times but requests for web pages are simply ignored with a timeout error when there are too many people in the town for any mast to cope with the number of data access requests being made.\xa0In addition to these repeated no service for data problems in Poole/Bournemouth and Portsmouth over the years I am also fnding virtually all of O2's H+ 3.5G masts covering train line routes in rural Surrey, Susses and Hampshire completely overwhelmed by data access requests for much of the time so that getting a response on single web page request often takes 30 to 60 seconds.\xa0 This makes it impossible to do say an oline grocery shop requiring a 100 web page interactions or more to complete a shopping order for 50 items.\xa0 But on my home Now Broadband ADSL2+ connections I never have any problems at all getting a rapid an timely response from web pages on the Sainsbury's online grocery shopping website.\n"", ""\n@Enlli\xa0I thought Lycamobile were with Vodafone but perhaps I am confusing them with Lyris Mobile or they changed from using Vodafone to O2 at some point.\xa0 It does seem that the directors of Telefonica just keep on taking on more and more customers and more and more data use of their already vastly stretched network with almost no regard at all for any customer detriment in terms of continuing to provide a reliable level of data services.\xa0Also chances are you drive everywhere rather than getting the train in which case you probably won't have tested out the real lack of abilities of O2's now very,very overloaded H+ transmitters (many years and years old and not upraded since original installation) that still cover most rural locations outside cities and towns in anger.\n"", ""\n@madasafish1 You obviously haven't called O2 much in the last year or so as these days there is an 80%+ chance your call will be taken in a call centre in South Africa.\xa0 Sainsburys groceries have quite a good and helpful South African call centre but O2's is absolutely terrible and most of the staff seem to dislike their customers, be very unhelpful and also be very difficult to understand in some but not all cases.\xa0As to no data service being available where I am having the issues O2's own coverage maps show they should have a good 4G or 5G data service in the areas I am having a problem in and my phone also shows a strong 4G or 5G signal from the cell mast.\xa0 But the problem is that data services are simply shutting off in the middle of the day because these masts are over contended by too many customers during peak summer periods in relation to their actual designed maximum data requests handling capacity.\xa0 If I try to use my phone in the same locations where I am getting no data service in the middle of the day in the evening instead I can use the internet and data without any problems as the masts are no longer overloaded at that time of day.\n"", ""\n@Capvermell\xa0\xa0I called them 2

As a long time user of the O2 network I was unaware of these latest rearrangments of the corporate deckchairs on the titanic by profiteering big business\xa0However the fact that the call centres of O2 are now run by Capita would explain their complete and utter dedication to avoiding the proper investigation of my complaint about their network shutting down for data access in popular summer leisure locations and for resorting as fast as possible to deadlocking my complaint while expending zero time and effort themselves on considering or investigating the issues I had raised.\xa0 Presumably they rely on the total uselessness and/or ineffectiveness of the Telecommunications Ombudsman to fail to hold them to account for not delivering me with a mobile data service when I most critically need to access it a large amount of the time.\xa0I believe Lycamobile is the other large network that accesses O2 under an MVNO arrangement like Tesco and Sky Mobile.\xa0 I apologise for confusing it with Lebara Mobile.\xa0However as I dislike all the corporate works of the Capita group intensely and EE is owned by BT (who I also dislike with a passion as a smoke and mirrors company that deliberately mistreats its customers) this leaves me with only Vodafone and Three as possible alternative networks.\xa0 As Three's signal does not penetrate buildings with thick brick walls and is deficient in its presence in much of rural Surrey this leaves me only with Vodafone............\xa0What I actually want is a cross network roaming SIM on all four networks at an affordable price but unfortunately the only such SIMs are very unaffordable price since they charge exorbitant foreign roaming rates for using data on the UK networks.......\n"", '\n@Capvermell\xa0Your only option as

observation of poor data on O2.I too live in a coastal resort, (Exmouth in Devon), and any time the seafront is busy and especially during holiday times, any use of data becomes almost impossible. I like to walk the two miles along the seafront and in off-peak times of the year, usually winter, I can stream the radio or a podcast while taking my constitutional, but as soon as there is any increase in the beach population, especially during holiday times, this becomes impossible and even trying to summon a web page can be futile. I'm sure this is for all the reasons that have been raised before, but I also work away from home from time to time, and this can be anywhere in the country, and again O2's data speeds have gradually become much worse over the past few years, and I'm not just talking about in the middle of a field in Gloucestershire, it can also be very poor in many urban areas. Signal strength is generally not the problem and making and receiving calls is usually fine, but O2 has certainly overstretched themselves in the data department, and I don't think the merger with Virgin is going to help much in the short term either.\n"", '\n@MrShifter\xa0Many thanks for confirming that in Exmouth you are also experiencing problems with O2\'s data services becoming completely unavailable for long periods at busy times of year for seaside visits (summer months on nice days) anywhere near the seafront and that you also confirm that this is not due to a lack of signal strength but due to data overload on the masts in question and/or the internet backhaul supporting them.\xa0Anyway my complaint is now in at Omudsman Services but all O2 have done is firstly to try and claim that I must be complaining about my home address in Surrey rather than as I have previously told them multiple times about seaside towns such as Portsmouth plus Bournemouth and Pool and also nearly all of their rural H+ cells that provide coverage when travelling between towns on a train journey.\xa0 Also in any case their average download speed, even at my home address on a 4G mast with a good signal has deteriorated from a poor 4Mbps 18 months ago in the weekday daytime to 1.5Mbps now while Upload Speeds have gone from 7Mbps to 8Mbps to about 0.5Mbps as they have clearly moved more of their bandwith suporting their mast on to the Download side to stop it shutting off completely at peak periods.\xa0Secondly O2 have referred to paragraph 2.2 of their terms and conditions and a paragraph that states ""The Service isn\'t fault-free; a range of different geographic, atmospheric or other conditions or circumstances beyond our control can impair it. For instance, coverage is affected by things like the thickness or material of the walls of the building you\'re in. It might also depend on how many people near you are trying to use the service at the same time.""\xa0So O2\'s position is that if they have provided mast capacity that is vastly inadequate in places that they know repeatedly suffer large day time peaks in data demand in the summer that none of their masts (in the case of Bournemouth/Pool and Portsmouth that\'s 5G, 4G+, 4G, 3.5G and 3G) can cope with then that\'s quite alright as paragraph 2.2 of their terms and conditions says that they can simply fail to offer data services whenever there are larger numbers of people in a summer time leisure location that are more in numbers than the average number throughout the course of the year that is all the mast capacity they have bothered to provide for.\xa0 And this is even though their 5G masts that are surely designed to cope with huge amounts of data throughput and are only two years old are also completely overloaded too whenever their data network shuts off.\xa0They haven\'t even bothered to investigate the actual data load on their network at the locations I am complaining about and they in any case try to make it impossible to complain about having data access problems in multiple locations in the same town or at a rural location without a postcode by always demanding a postcode rather than GPS Coordinates or an OS grid reference and also fail to provide any button in their app to report a specific location you cannot access data services at when this could be uploaded by their App whenever the phone was back in an area with working data service.\xa0Rather than being shocked and appalled that I could not access data services for days on end for 10 days in a row in Bournemouth in August O2\'s attitude is that I am not entitled to expect their data services to work whenever they are incapable of providing them due to data overload and that the measly £30 or so they have paid me so far on a 100Gb SIM only contract that cost me £300 over 18 months (£20 x £18 minus £10 a month discount for the first 6 months) but that my average data use is only 10Mbps to 20Mbps a month (in large part because I can\'t access their data services so much of the time) is perfectly adequate and that I should receive no further compensation.\xa0And they seem smugly confident that Ombudsman Services will back them up on this position.\xa0But the last thing one ever gets with O2 is a call back from a concerned network engineering department that wants to investigate matters further and put things right...........\n']"

Considering my options after a stolen device,"[""\nHi my S21 Ultra was stolen and not insured for loss/theft.I'm currently using my slightly damaged S9 which is fine except for photography. Using my older S9 is not ideal because I upgraded so I can use multiple lenses/cameras for photography and videography.\xa0I initially reported my phone stolen with O2 and the police, but then asked O2 to unblock the device so I could track it's location. Using offline tracking provided by Samsung the phone appeared in Romania shortly after it was stolen.\xa0My options now with the existing refresh contract seem to be:\xa0- Upgrade and pay the remainder of the contract for the device which is over £700 in order to buy a new device from O2 with a single line.\xa0- Take up a second line with O2 and pay off both the stolen and new devices and contracts simultaneously\xa0- Take up a contract for a new device with a different provider, request a PAC code and disconnect my o2 account leaving me with a debt of over £700 and then see if the payment management team will set up a payment plan for that debt.\xa0- Keep using my S9 and not be able to enjoy my passion of mobile photography and videography as much due to the single camera not performing very well when a telephoto lens is more suited (as digital zoom is not really the way I want to go with my photography)\xa0- Buy a replacement device outright (or on finance) that has adequate photography and video capabilities and use my existing O2 contract and SIM with a new device.\xa0All of these options are somewhat disheartening as I'm trying to reduce my spending, but still enjoy the features that newer phones bring.I will make sure I'm insured against theft in future that's for sure!\xa0I don't necessarily need to do photography and video and the damage to the S9 is workable (I just can't use the volume buttons as they are damaged) but I'd have to wait a long time (until Dec 2024) for my current contract (device plan) to be fully paid off.\xa0I've spoken to customer services, sales and payment management now for many hours to see if there's anything they can do to soften the blow, and the answer was no, hence the current options available to me.\xa0I'm more than happy to consider a more affordable handset such as a Google Pixel, Xiaomi Redmi Note, OnePlus Nord, Realme, and other Samsung Galaxy models. Basically anything with good rear cameras that isn't made by Apple and isn't a knock-off product (ie. it's from a reputable manufacturer).\xa0Is there anything I've missed, or perhaps any suggestions that you can bring? What would you do in this situation or what have others done when in the same boat as me? Thank you!\n"", ""\nDaughter has a Pixel 6 Pro.

It's an absolute steal, has considerable advantages over the Redmi Note 11 Pro (the latest model).I'm currently looking at used handsets as I'm counting the pennies and I've models in new or good condition for £170 or £180 (delivered) which I believe include warranty. I'd be looking at around double or more of the cost to be able to get a camera system that performs anywhere near as well, although the proof is in the pudding. To help me get back on track there are 0% interest finance options available using Klarna (which I've not used before) which is looking good to me as I can spread the payment over 3 months.I have kept the tracking of my stolen phone possible by means of leaving it unblocked on the basis that the data is secured (encrypted) and the phone is locked.My next steps might be to look into some queries:- Is it possible for someone handling my stolen handset to use it in any way shape or form?- Is my encrypted data safe?- For any data which isn't encrypted or is able to be gathered (ie. on the home screen) what are the security considerations for how that data may be used?- If there is a way for others to use the phone (ie. factory reset) should I ask the Romanian authorities if it is possible to notify me if the IMEI linked to the physical hardware (the phone) is ever used to make calls/texts? This alert is in place only in the UK at the moment, and via a global IMEI tracking service/website. Individual countries and authorities will have more scope for tracking IMEI's than 3rd party services as they are able to utilise the live data from major networks as opposed to relying on historic databases. The last known location of my phone was in a specific part of a town/city in Romania so I could make some guesses as to where it may have gone from there or how it may have been used (or left in a pile somewhere if deemed unusable due to the protections I had set up).\n"", ""\nUpdate: It's now possible to buy the Redmi Note 10 Pro brand new in box for £155 (delivered, UK) which sounds like a better deal than a used model for £170 to me!The Redmi Note 12 is expected for release on 14th Sept (in 4 days time) but I don't think it will immediately bring the price of the Note 10 Pro down much as it is already so cheap.\n"", ""\n@dreas\xa0I'm not quite sure why you still think you need to keep tracking your stolen phone?
