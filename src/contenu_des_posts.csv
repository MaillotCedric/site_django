"O2 device plan is a SCAM!,","[""\nSo guys if any of you ordered an iPhone XS Max brand new when they were released, make sure you weren't overcharged!! I was overcharged by £158 as the retail of my version was £1249 at the time on Apple themselves, however the device plan was £1407.99 on o2 which they have refused to rectify. I have put in a complaint to o2 which will hopefully be sorted, but did threaten them with the ombudsman, which they got scared of and assured me o2s complaints would get a good outcome. So check!! If you have a Xs Max 256gb check you were not charged over 1249. Or at most any more than 1300!!!\n"", '\nWell, good luck with that.

O2 and EE were the worst overall. Coverage was middle of the table, but price was bottom being the highest. Tesco came top.

Each to their own choice though.I am lucky enough to have my own phone bought outright, so am Sim only.
