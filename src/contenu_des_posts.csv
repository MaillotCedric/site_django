I'll paste below:\n\xa0\nNew devices come with 3 sims so you can choose the size which fits your phone\n\xa0\nA SIM card is sent with the 3 size option: Standard, Micro and Nano SIM. You just need to break out what size you require. It is detailed on the card what area you need to break out for what size. A recommendation is to do it carefully as breaking out the Nano when a Mirco SIM is needed will require a whole new SIM to be sent.\n\xa0\nIs the sim blank or does it have a temporary number attached?\xa0\n\xa0\nThere is no number attached to a replacement Pay Monthly SIM card, it is blank.\n\xa0\nFinally the question we are always being asked is, do I do the swap from my old sim or the new one?\xa0\n\xa0\nIf texting\xa0'Swap' to\xa020220 to activate the SIM this needs to be sent from the old SIM only, the new SIM won‚Äôt be active to enable this.\n\xa0\nSIM swaps can now also be actioned via your My O2 app. You‚Äôll find an option under ‚ÄòManage your account‚Äô of ‚ÄòSwap your SIM‚Äô. You‚Äôll need to re-enter your My O2 username and password, you‚Äôll then be sent a verification code via text to your phone. Once this has been confirmed you can enter your new SIM info and this will be swapped within 24hrs.\n\xa0\nAs mentioned above you can also text ‚ÄòSwap‚Äô to 20220 to activate it.\n\xa0\nIf you don‚Äôt have an active SIM to do either of the above to you‚Äôll need to call customer services to activate it.

Wrong charges,"['\nHonestly this company has done nothing but try to scam me, I took out a contract in July in store and returned it with the 14 day cooling off period. However I then took out a new contract online from o2 which was supposed to be ¬£37 a month- NEXT JOKE! However every single time a payment has been made from my account it has seemed to be nearly double this ! Then they took ¬£600 from my bank account which was an ""error"" they could not refund me with this amount so I had to contact my bank wo then told me they had set up a direct debit for ¬£600 to be taken on the first of every month !! I phoned up o2 and was told that it was a mistake, my bill was then ¬£76 and my bank has blocked all payments from o2 due to the ¬£600 direct debit charge so I phoned up to ask why it was this amount and I got told that they didn\'t know? Next they blocked my service without making me aware of the issue or informing me: I contacted them and they told me my account was credited this amount due to it being another "" error"" two weeks later my account is blocked again and I have no service I phone up and it was due to the ¬£76 which was meant to be credited- I was on the phone for over an hour and no resolution- I then paid the fee as I was working away alone for the week so that I could receive my service back, bear in mind this was at 10pm! I then phone up again to get my service and contract sorted however due to the incompetence \xa0of all the colleagues here I am again with another bill of ¬£130 from o2 which I will be left to fight for!

Using offline tracking provided by Samsung the phone appeared in Romania shortly after it was stolen.\xa0My options now with the existing refresh contract seem to be:\xa0- Upgrade and pay the remainder of the contract for the device which is over ¬£700 in order to buy a new device from O2 with a single line.\xa0- Take up a second line with O2 and pay off both the stolen and new devices and contracts simultaneously\xa0- Take up a contract for a new device with a different provider, request a PAC code and disconnect my o2 account leaving me with a debt of over ¬£700 and then see if the payment management team will set up a payment plan for that debt.\xa0- Keep using my S9 and not be able to enjoy my passion of mobile photography and videography as much due to the single camera not performing very well when a telephoto lens is more suited (as digital zoom is not really the way I want to go with my photography)\xa0- Buy a replacement device outright (or on finance) that has adequate photography and video capabilities and use my existing O2 contract and SIM with a new device.\xa0All of these options are somewhat disheartening as I'm trying to reduce my spending, but still enjoy the features that newer phones bring.I will make sure I'm insured against theft in future that's for sure!\xa0I don't necessarily need to do photography and video and the damage to the S9 is workable (I just can't use the volume buttons as they are damaged) but I'd have to wait a long time (until Dec 2024) for my current contract (device plan) to be fully paid off.\xa0I've spoken to customer services, sales and payment management now for many hours to see if there's anything they can do to soften the blow, and the answer was no, hence the current options available to me.\xa0I'm more than happy to consider a more affordable handset such as a Google Pixel, Xiaomi Redmi Note, OnePlus Nord, Realme, and other Samsung Galaxy models. Basically anything with good rear cameras that isn't made by Apple and isn't a knock-off product (ie. it's from a reputable manufacturer).\xa0Is there anything I've missed, or perhaps any suggestions that you can bring? What would you do in this situation or what have others done when in the same boat as me? Thank you!\n"", ""\nDaughter has a Pixel 6 Pro. Have to say I'm impressed by the photos\xa0\n"", ""\n@dreas\xa0Have you checked your house contents insurance to see if you're covered?\n\n\tI have no affiliation whatsoever with O2 or any subsidiary companies.

A lesson learnt. Now to figure out what to do, but there is no major rush so I'll reflect and ponder and see what suggestions I can crowdsource to inspire me to make some wise next steps \n"", ""\nI thought it was time to update this thread, especially now it's been kindly moved over into the 'discussions & feedback' section of the community.I think my absolute no1. choice for phone replace is looking like it will be the Xiaomi Redmi Note 10 Pro. It's an absolute steal, has considerable advantages over the Redmi Note 11 Pro (the latest model).I'm currently looking at used handsets as I'm counting the pennies and I've models in new or good condition for ¬£170 or ¬£180 (delivered) which I believe include warranty. I'd be looking at around double or more of the cost to be able to get a camera system that performs anywhere near as well, although the proof is in the pudding. To help me get back on track there are 0% interest finance options available using Klarna (which I've not used before) which is looking good to me as I can spread the payment over 3 months.I have kept the tracking of my stolen phone possible by means of leaving it unblocked on the basis that the data is secured (encrypted) and the phone is locked.My next steps might be to look into some queries:- Is it possible for someone handling my stolen handset to use it in any way shape or form?- Is my encrypted data safe?- For any data which isn't encrypted or is able to be gathered (ie. on the home screen) what are the security considerations for how that data may be used?- If there is a way for others to use the phone (ie. factory reset) should I ask the Romanian authorities if it is possible to notify me if the IMEI linked to the physical hardware (the phone) is ever used to make calls/texts? This alert is in place only in the UK at the moment, and via a global IMEI tracking service/website. Individual countries and authorities will have more scope for tracking IMEI's than 3rd party services as they are able to utilise the live data from major networks as opposed to relying on historic databases. The last known location of my phone was in a specific part of a town/city in Romania so I could make some guesses as to where it may have gone from there or how it may have been used (or left in a pile somewhere if deemed unusable due to the protections I had set up).\n"", ""\nUpdate: It's now possible to buy the Redmi Note 10 Pro brand new in box for ¬£155 (delivered, UK) which sounds like a better deal than a used model for ¬£170 to me!The Redmi Note 12 is expected for release on 14th Sept (in 4 days time) but I don't think it will immediately bring the price of the Note 10 Pro down much as it is already so cheap.\n"", ""\n@dreas\xa0I'm not quite sure why you still think you need to keep tracking your stolen phone? You're not going to get it back, and you're leaving the possibility of any personal data you had on the phone open to being compromised. Nothing is 100% secure, so why leave the chance of anyone getting access to the phone? You really should block the phone completely, make it unusable to whoever has it now and move on.\n\nI DO NOT WORK FOR O2\n\n"", '\nWhy not simply remote wipe it and get\xa0 it blocked\n\nO2 Social Media(Twitter | Instagram | Facebook)\n\n', '\nYou and\xa0@jonsie make a very good point, the chances of getting it back are slim.I think the chances of being able to remotely wipe the data are also slim though, and that may have been the case since the phone was stolen and immediately turned off. I couldn\'t say which is more likely to happen, but I think that if there is a 2% chance of getting the phone back, then there is probably less than 1% chance of being able to remotely wipe the data at this (or any) stage, maybe even 0.01%.\xa0If I had wiped the data immediately after loss, I would never have known it was stolen (it could have been dropped and found) and I wouldn\'t have received the notification of it\'s location through offline tracking. I don\'t think remotely wiping the data would have worked as the phone was only ever tracked through offline tracking once, and the way that offline tracking works is that another Samsung device has detected my phone through a wireless or other network. I\'m not sure that the connection from another Samsung device detecting my phone would have been able to be used to send the command back to the phone to wipe it.From Samsung: ""After using the Factory Data Reset option\xa0you will no longer be able to use the Find My Mobile service.""\xa0The chances of someone being able to access my encrypted data are also slim, and they are so slim that I think it\'s considerably more likely that they would find a way to wipe the data as opposed to decrypting it.Whilst nothing is 100% secure, if we were to assume the encryption methods are 99.99% secure then that would certainly be secure enough for my peace of mind in this instance.\xa0As reusing the device requires a considerable amount of work, and as it was stolen along with a large volume of other phones and taken 1000 miles away, my best guess is that it\'s been discarded and the phones without high levels of encryption used first.\n', ""\nHi my S21 Ultra was stolen and not insured for loss/theft.I'm currently using my slightly damaged S9 which is fine except for photography.
