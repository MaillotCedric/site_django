In the store, you might ask the O2 person if they can re-provision your SIM for iPhone and iData etc - there have been a few instances on the Forum where this fixed such issues, and has to be done by O2. They may issue a new SIM card, correctly provisioned for an iPhone, so make sure the roaming bar has been removed from the new SIM too before you leave the shop, @Darren123456.

SCAM,"['\nJust received a scam phone call from a number listed as Glasgow, Scotland. The number was 0141 628 2042. The number informed me that o2 had selected me for a discount of 40% on my phone bill. The person knew my name and my phone number, and that I was an o2 customer which is highly worrying in itself.\xa0\xa0More worryingly, they informed me on the phone they would send me a one time code to access the discount which I needed to read to them. What they had done was typed my number into Myo2 and clicked reset password which sends me a text from o2 to reset. This could help the scammers because the password comes from the legitimate o2 number however if I had read it out they would have had access to change my password and to all my payment and banking details.\xa0This could be dangerous for people who are less confident with technology etc so please stay alert and inform anybody you know who may be susceptible to this kind of scam.\xa0\n', '\n@Niamh11\xa0Block the number and report it free to 7726.Donâ€™t give the caller any information.O2 advice here:https://www.o2.co.uk/help/safety-and-security/phishing-and-smishing-advicehttps://www.actionfraud.police.uk/How to block a number:https://www.samsung.com/us/support/answer/ANS00062352/https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201229https://www.o2.co.uk/help/safety-and-security/unwanted-calls-and-messages\n\nI DO NOT WORK FOR O2\n\n', '\nHi,\xa0\xa0Yes I knew it was a scam but just posted as Iâ€™d never seen this scam before and thought others may not have.\xa0\xa0\n', ""\n@Niamh11\xa0Sad to say these calls and text scams have been making the rounds for years, but it's good that you were aware of it and have alerted others.\n\nI DO NOT WORK FOR O2\n\n"", ""\nIf an unknown number rings an it doesn't start +44141 xxxx xxxx for example.

Why is the O2 network so bad?,"[""\nSo a few months ago I joined O2 to take advantage of the free EU roaming and also the Virgin Media free upgrade. I'm paying Â£10 a month for 30GB of data, which is now double to 60GB thanks to the Volt deal. While I am pretty happy with the price and the amount of data I am getting, I am not at all happy with the data speeds I am getting, at all! It's basically unusable.\xa0I recently took a visit to North Wales and visited many different towns over a 3 days weekend but the internet was pretty much completely unusable. Despite having full 4G signal in most places, some speed tests were completely failing, eventually got some speed tests work and got between 0.01 Mbps and 0.8 Mbps down.\xa0In Liverpool, standing outside central station, a speed test was 0.06 Mbps down on full 4G signal. Outside M&S arena, on half 4G signal, speed tests completely fail. I tried for an hour, couldn't get on the internet at all. Even throughout the city where there was 5G, the speed tests didn't really get any better than 5 Mbps.\xa0In Manchester, standing in St Peters Square, again on full signal, speed test are typically under 1 Mbps down. Moving around the city the speed tests can improve to 10 Mbps, but for 4G in 2022 even that's very poor.\xa0In Warrington, again the best download was 3.3 Mbps, with an upload of 0.16 Mbps upload.\xa0The train line between Liverpool and Manchester, while there is always coverage, the internet is completely unusable for most of the journey.\xa0I was almost starting to believe my phone was broken, but having taken two trips to Europe since joining O2, I don't believe it is. Having spent a time in four European countries, I haven't seen a speed test less than 64 Mbps, with speeds up to 155 Mbps\xa0\xa0So why is O2 so terrible in the UK?\n"", '\n@BearHug\xa0Simple answer is an oversubscribed network.Try dropping to 3g and you may find it faster.\n\n\tI have no affiliation whatsoever with O2 or any subsidiary companies.
