O2 Data Network Unavailable For Hours At A Time At Many Popular Summer Leisure Destinations,"[""\nI am now at the end of an 18 month O2 contract period on a 100Gb SIM only contract (my handsets is a One Plus Nord N10 5G unit that I bought from Amazon Warehouse for £160 in May 2021) and have been pursuing this issue of O2 data services both being absurdly slow to respond and then more recently shutting off completely for hours in many popular summer leisure locations (all of which have a strong signal strength but who's mast capacity and/or back haul networks are completely and utterly inadequate to handle peak time demand) repeatedly with O2's phone customer services team on 202, then multiple times with their in my experience completely and utterly useless and unfit for purpose CRT or Customer Relations Team, then due to their total uselessness and failure to do anything at all to actually investigate the repeated lack of data service I finally escalated onwards to the Complaints Review Service of O2.\xa0 The Complaints Review Service turned out to be even more useless and unhelpful than the CRT team and did no technical investigation whatsoever of any kind of my multiple experiences of lack of any data service in busy seaside and beach locations between 11am and around 5pm and simply deadlocked my complaint and said I could leave O2 if I was not happy.\xa0 As a result of this the matter is now with the Communications Ombudsman section of\xa0www.ombudsman-services.org\xa0Surely multiple other customers must also have experience of the O2 network simply shutting down completely at the busiest times of day at popular summer leisure locations where a lot of people gather in the middle of the day and in my case in the Poole/Bournemouth area while last year my then shiny new OnePlus Nord N10 5G handset worked well on their recently activated 5G cell serving a beach location at Knoll Beach in Studland where mobile services were often previously overloaded and unavailable in earlier years on busy days this year the 5G and 4G cells are so overloaded with traffic they chuck you off on to an H+ 3.5G cell and that then that simply fails to come back with any response to requests for web pages at all.\xa0O2's total failure to either acknowledge or properly investigate a problem that it has caused for its own network by selling far too many high capacity data plans on O2 itself and on GiffGaff, Tesco Mobile and Sky Mobile (as its more significant MVNOs) is in my opinion quite disgusting and shocking.\xa0 Most but not all calls to 202 now get routed to call centres in Cape Town in South Africa where some but not all of the advisers clearly feel no sense of responsibility at all for the network data overload problem working for an outsourced third party centre handling company in another country on probably very low pay.\xa0 But often the UK is no better and one lady in their Leeds call centre couldn't seem to understand that I could be in area that her coverage maps showed I had a strong signal but where no data service was available currently due to the mast cells being completely over contended with data requests way beyond their design capacity.\xa0O2 or Telefonica's whole staff training in relation to this issue is quite diabolical since rather than ever admitting data is not available currently because their network is overloaded with too many data requests from customers in relation to cell design capacity they will always suggest the problem must be with your handset and can be easily fixed as long as you carry out a Network Reset. Alternatively they will suggest sending you a new SIM card as the solution as that of course wastes a few more days while it arrives and as with the 72 working hours for their CRT team to phone you back (except that they when they call back they always call for one and a half rings and then hang up so they can mark down that the customer was unavailable) or the 240 working hours for their Complaints Review Service to get back to you deadlocking your complaint but doing no investigation they are all obfuscations techniques designed to prevent Telefonica having to admit it has destroyed the reliability of its own data network in locations subject to seasonal and/or time of day related major surges in demand.\xa0 Yet a further obfuscation tactic that O2 has trained its customer service staff in is to always suggest that the problem must be occurring at your home address (even though most customers still use a much more reliable fixed line data connection via ADSL2+, FTTC or FTTP when they are at their home address) and to suggest they have not had any probelms reported at that postcode.\xa0 But when you then tell them you are at some beach or other you have no idea of the postcode for they then say they cannot help you without a postcode.\xa0 So if you then try and give them your current GPS or OS Grid coordinates using an appropriate mobile location App they then tell you they cannot use those coordinates to find your location.\xa0 These are all in my humble opinion quite deliberate further Obfuscatory tactics used by O2 customer services to avoid having to deal with your complaint about lack of data services completely or unaccepably slow data service.\xa0 Thsat is of course assuming the customer has not given up as they seem to hope you will do when some of their ruder advisers (especially in South Africa) suddenly cut customers off without warning for no discernible reason.\xa0As I live in an area of rural southern Surrey where EE and Three's network appear to be especially poor I am planning to give Vodafone a go via Talkmobile as they can sell me a 25Gb data plan on only a 1 month contract for £12 a month.\xa0 I am reluctant to try either EE or Three as their service here at my home with my foot thick victorian brick walls is so bad that I couldn't even use my mobile here as a portable wifi hotspot in the event that my fixed line internet connection with Sky (via BT Openreach's FTTP network) goes down.\xa0I can't believe I am the only person who has been suffering with many hour long total data network outages on O2 this summer in peak hour periods at popular seaside and other summertime leisure activity related locations where there is perfectly adequate H+, 4G, 4G+ or 5G data service at less busy and therefore less heavily data trafficked times of the day or year, and where phone calls still continue to work throughout the day even though data services do not at peak times of day, and I would appreciate feedback in this thread from anyone else who has been suffering with the same total loss of data service at peak times of day issue on the O2 network.\xa0 Not only do data services go out completely in some peak summer leisure locations but they are also in general getting much slower so that this morning at my home address in Capel, Surrey the local mast could only manage a measly 1.2Mbps download speed and 0.2 Mbps in the mid morning when 18 months ago it could do 4Mbps Download and Upload at about 11Mbps in the mid morning before they redeployed most of the upload bandwidth on the mast to downloading use to stop that giving up completely.\xa0 Yet this same mast can return a download speed test result of around 20Mbps at 3am in the morning.........................\n"", ""\n@Capvermell\xa0To be honest, no I haven't suffered this in any tourist heavy places that I am near such as the Peak District, or the East Coast from Ingoldmells all the way to Whitby and further up the coast to Redcar..

also had the same issue for several years with all data access shutting down completeley at peak hours in the middle of the day on O2 at Eastney Beach in Portsmouth, which is on the South Eastern edge of a large town.\xa0 Yet repeatedly O2's network could not cope over several years with the additional number of people brought in to the town to use the beaches on any warm and sunny summer day including weekdays but weekends were worst of all with data shutting down very early in the day.\xa0This year some time after May O2 finally solved the problem by upgrading a mast that covers the Eastney part of Portsmouth (which may well turn out to be a mast just across the water on the Isle of Wight) to 4G+ instead of 4G and now data services do seem to keep working during the day.\xa0 O2 also have a 5G cell somewhere between 2 and 3 miles west of Eastney somewhere between South Parade Pier and Clarence Pier.\xa0 At both these pier locations a 5G signal generally shows on my OnePlus N10 handset (it never has done since the start of the 5G transmitter there on the part of Eastney Beach near Fort Cumberland) but when the like Poole/Bournemouth when the town is really busy the capacity of the 5G mast simply isn't adequate so you get chucked off it first on to the 4G mast and then when that is overloaded too on to\xa0 the H+ mast.\xa0 You stay connected to the H+ mast in Central Portsmouth at busy times but requests for web pages are simply ignored with a timeout error when there are too many people in the town for any mast to cope with the number of data access requests being made.\xa0In addition to these repeated no service for data problems in Poole/Bournemouth and Portsmouth over the years I am also fnding virtually all of O2's H+ 3.5G masts covering train line routes in rural Surrey, Susses and Hampshire completely overwhelmed by data access requests for much of the time so that getting a response on single web page request often takes 30 to 60 seconds.\xa0 This makes it impossible to do say an oline grocery shop requiring a 100 web page interactions or more to complete a shopping order for 50 items.\xa0 But on my home Now Broadband ADSL2+ connections I never have any problems at all getting a rapid an timely response from web pages on the Sainsbury's online grocery shopping website.\n"", ""\n@Enlli\xa0I thought Lycamobile were with Vodafone but perhaps I am confusing them with Lyris Mobile or they changed from using Vodafone to O2 at some point.\xa0 It does seem that the directors of Telefonica just keep on taking on more and more customers and more and more data use of their already vastly stretched network with almost no regard at all for any customer detriment in terms of continuing to provide a reliable level of data services.\xa0Also chances are you drive everywhere rather than getting the train in which case you probably won't have tested out the real lack of abilities of O2's now very,very overloaded H+ transmitters (many years and years old and not upraded since original installation) that still cover most rural locations outside cities and towns in anger.\n"", ""\n@madasafish1 You obviously haven't called O2 much in the last year or so as these days there is an 80%+ chance your call will be taken in a call centre in South Africa.\xa0 Sainsburys groceries have quite a good and helpful South African call centre but O2's is absolutely terrible and most of the staff seem to dislike their customers, be very unhelpful and also be very difficult to understand in some but not all cases.\xa0As to no data service being available where I am having the issues O2's own coverage maps show they should have a good 4G or 5G data service in the areas I am having a problem in and my phone also shows a strong 4G or 5G signal from the cell mast.\xa0 But the problem is that data services are simply shutting off in the middle of the day because these masts are over contended by too many customers during peak summer periods in relation to their actual designed maximum data requests handling capacity.\xa0 If I try to use my phone in the same locations where I am getting no data service in the middle of the day in the evening instead I can use the internet and data without any problems as the masts are no longer overloaded at that time of day.\n"", ""\n@Capvermell\xa0\xa0I called them 2

tell you they cannot use those coordinates to find your location.\xa0 These are all in my humble opinion quite deliberate further Obfuscatory tactics used by O2 customer services to avoid having to deal with your complaint about lack of data services completely or unaccepably slow data service.\xa0 Thsat is of course assuming the customer has not given up as they seem to hope you will do when some of their ruder advisers (especially in South Africa) suddenly cut customers off without warning for no discernible reason.\xa0As I live in an area of rural southern Surrey where EE and Three's network appear to be especially poor I am planning to give Vodafone a go via Talkmobile as they can sell me a 25Gb data plan on only a 1 month contract for £12 a month.\xa0 I am reluctant to try either EE or Three as their service here at my home with my foot thick victorian brick walls is so bad that I couldn't even use my mobile here as a portable wifi hotspot in the event that my fixed line internet connection with Sky (via BT Openreach's FTTP network) goes down.\xa0I can't believe I am the only person who has been suffering with many hour long total data network outages on O2 this summer in peak hour periods at popular seaside and other summertime leisure activity related locations where there is perfectly adequate H+, 4G, 4G+ or 5G data service at less busy and therefore less heavily data trafficked times of the day or year, and where phone calls still continue to work throughout the day even though data services do not at peak times of day, and I would appreciate feedback in this thread from anyone else who has been suffering with the same total loss of data service at peak times of day issue on the O2 network.\xa0 Not only do data services go out completely in some

As a long time user of the O2 network I was unaware of these latest rearrangments of the corporate deckchairs on the titanic by profiteering big business\xa0However the fact that the call centres of O2 are now run by Capita would explain their complete and utter dedication to avoiding the proper investigation of my complaint about their network shutting down for data access in popular summer leisure locations and for resorting as fast as possible to deadlocking my complaint while expending zero time and effort themselves on considering or investigating the issues I had raised.\xa0 Presumably they rely on the total uselessness and/or ineffectiveness of the Telecommunications Ombudsman to fail to hold them to account for not delivering me with a mobile data service when I most critically need to access it a large amount of the time.\xa0I believe Lycamobile is the other large network that accesses O2 under an MVNO arrangement like Tesco and Sky Mobile.\xa0 I apologise for confusing it with Lebara Mobile.\xa0However as I dislike all the corporate works of the Capita group intensely and EE is owned by BT (who I also dislike with a passion as a smoke and mirrors company that deliberately mistreats its customers) this leaves me with only Vodafone and Three as possible alternative networks.\xa0 As Three's signal does not penetrate buildings with thick brick walls and is deficient in its presence in much of rural Surrey this leaves me only with Vodafone............\xa0What I actually want is a cross network roaming SIM on all four networks at an affordable price but unfortunately the only such SIMs are very unaffordable price since they charge exorbitant foreign roaming rates for using data on the UK networks.......\n"", '\n@Capvermell\xa0Your only option as

observation of poor data on O2.I too live in a coastal resort, (Exmouth in Devon), and any time the seafront is busy and especially during holiday times, any use of data becomes almost impossible. I like to walk the two miles along the seafront and in off-peak times of the year, usually winter, I can stream the radio or a podcast while taking my constitutional, but as soon as there is any increase in the beach population, especially during holiday times, this becomes impossible and even trying to summon a web page can be futile. I'm sure this is for all the reasons that have been raised before, but I also work away from home from time to time, and this can be anywhere in the country, and again O2's data speeds have gradually become much worse over the past few years, and I'm not just talking about in the middle of a field in Gloucestershire, it can also be very poor in many urban areas. Signal strength is generally not the problem and making and receiving calls is usually fine, but O2 has certainly overstretched themselves in the data department, and I don't think the merger with Virgin is going to help much in the short term either.\n"", '\n@MrShifter\xa0Many thanks for confirming that in Exmouth you are also experiencing problems with O2\'s data services becoming completely unavailable for long periods at busy times of year for seaside visits (summer months on nice days) anywhere near the seafront and that you also confirm that this is not due to a lack of signal strength but due to data overload on the masts in question and/or the internet backhaul supporting them.\xa0Anyway my complaint is now in at Omudsman Services but all O2 have done is firstly to try and claim that I must be complaining about my home address in Surrey rather than as I have previously told them multiple times about seaside towns such as Portsmouth plus Bournemouth and Pool and also nearly all of their rural H+ cells that provide coverage when travelling between towns on a train journey.\xa0 Also in any case their average download speed, even at my home address on a 4G mast with a good signal has deteriorated from a poor 4Mbps 18 months ago in the weekday daytime to 1.5Mbps now while Upload Speeds have gone from 7Mbps to 8Mbps to about 0.5Mbps as they have clearly moved more of their bandwith suporting their mast on to the Download side to stop it shutting off completely at peak periods.\xa0Secondly O2 have referred to paragraph 2.2 of their terms and conditions and a paragraph that states ""The Service isn\'t fault-free; a range of different geographic, atmospheric or other conditions or circumstances beyond our control can impair it. For instance, coverage is affected by things like the thickness or material of the walls of the building you\'re in. It might also depend on how many people near you are trying to use the service at the same time.""\xa0So O2\'s position is that if they have provided mast capacity that is vastly inadequate in places that they know repeatedly suffer large day time peaks in data demand in the summer that none of their masts (in the case of Bournemouth/Pool and Portsmouth that\'s 5G, 4G+, 4G, 3.5G and 3G) can cope with then that\'s quite alright as paragraph 2.2 of their terms and conditions says that they can simply fail to offer data services whenever there are larger numbers of people in a summer time leisure location that are more in numbers than the average number throughout the course of the year that is all the mast capacity they have bothered to provide for.\xa0 And this is even though their 5G masts that are surely designed to cope with huge amounts of data throughput and are only two years old are also completely overloaded too whenever their data network shuts off.\xa0They haven\'t even bothered to investigate the actual data load on their network at the locations I am complaining about and they in any case try to make it impossible to complain about having data access problems in multiple locations in the same town or at a rural location without a postcode by always demanding a postcode rather than GPS Coordinates or an OS grid reference and also fail to provide any button in their app to report a specific location you cannot access data services at when this could be uploaded by their App whenever the phone was back in an area with working data service.\xa0Rather than being shocked and appalled that I could not access data services for days on end for 10 days in a row in Bournemouth in August O2\'s attitude is that I am not entitled to expect their data services to work whenever they are incapable of providing them due to data overload and that the measly £30 or so they have paid me so far on a 100Gb SIM only contract that cost me £300 over 18 months (£20 x £18 minus £10 a month discount for the first 6 months) but that my average data use is only 10Mbps to 20Mbps a month (in large part because I can\'t access their data services so much of the time) is perfectly adequate and that I should receive no further compensation.\xa0And they seem smugly confident that Ombudsman Services will back them up on this position.\xa0But the last thing one ever gets with O2 is a call back from a concerned network engineering department that wants to investigate matters further and put things right...........\n']"
